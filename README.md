# Agent Skills

A collection of skills for AI coding agents.

## Skills

- **[gdb](skills/gdb)** — Non-blocking debugging with the GNU Debugger (GDB). Trace live C/C++/Rust processes without the agent ever blocking on a breakpoint.

## Supported Agents

Works with any agent that can run shell commands, including Cursor, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and others.

## Quick Start

Copy the skill folder into your project or agent skills directory. The agent will pick it up automatically.
